Samplestack Node.js/Express.js Application Server
=================================================

What is it?
-----------

The implementation of Samplestack that runs using

-	JavaScript as middle-tier development language
-	Node.js runtime platform
-	Express.js as an application framework
-	MarkLogic as database tier
-	gulp as a build tool
-	Angular.js as a browser application

Development is underway – come back soon to see progress. Soon you’ll be able to see how to effectively build a Node.js application on top of MarkLogic.
